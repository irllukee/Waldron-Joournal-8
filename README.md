The client was The Gaming Room, a company that wanted to expand its game Draw It or Lose It from a single-platform environment into a cross-platform application. They needed support for multiple teams, unique players, game sessions, and scalability.

I did well in clearly organizing the design into logical sections, especially enforcing unique identifiers for players and teams and outlining scalable architecture choices.

Creating the design first made the coding process easier and more structured. It gave me a roadmap and reduced guesswork later on.

I would revise the platform analysis section to go deeper into cloud deployment and containerization options. That would make the design stronger for long-term scalability.

I translated user needs into specific requirements like unique team IDs, session management, and responsive gameplay. Considering user needs is critical because software only succeeds if it solves real problems for its users.

I approached the design by breaking the system into classes, responsibilities, and relationships using UML diagrams and requirements traceability. In the future, I would continue this approach but add more iterative stakeholder feedback sessions to refine the design earlier.
